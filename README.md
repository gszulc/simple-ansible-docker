This repo shows one of the ways to meet following conditions:
```
Deploy a simple app that outputs the list of employees that are Male which birth date is 1965-02-01 and the hire date is greater than 1990-01-01 ordered by the Full Name of the employee.

You will have to use Ubuntu 18.04 LTS as starting base and the solution needs to have the following items:

- NGINX web server
- Any programming language (PHP/Python/Perl/Whatever).
- MySQL server
- Configuration Management tool for configuring server (You can use Saltstack/Ansible/Puppet/Chef, is allowed to use modules/formulas/cookbooks from others so you don't reinvent the wheel but please don't do copy&paste solutions or use things like PuPHPet).
```

There is one `mandatory requirement`, your VM needs to be connected to the internet.
